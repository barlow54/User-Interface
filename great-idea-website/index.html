            Saturday at midnight law enforcement is to begin ensuring my business (and others) is closed under threat of revoking licenses, fines, and imprisonment. Now, bear in mind the govenor has no power to restrict business in thus manner, but I don't have the pockets to risk being made example of. This is already going to put a serious hurt on my livelihood and business.

            States—and their cities and counties by extension—possess what has long been known as a “police power” to govern for the health, welfare and safety of their citizens. This broad authority, which can be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment, is far from radical; it justifies why states can regulate at all.

            The police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers
             of the federal governmentfor example, in Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in the 2012 Obamacare case. This power also has been recognized in the context of public health for decades. In a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccinations, the court observed

            What does this mean for the drastic coronavirus responses we’re seeing across the country? State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary.

            police power due to disease is pointed missing in Pennsylvania statutes. At the end of the day I am a staunch civil libertarian. If you are at risk, you enforce your own quarantine. You cannot (should not) restrict the rights and liberties of others for your own safety. This is the same logic used to argue against guns.
